Drek's Plugin Pack

There is 1 plugin included here.

mod_csw_dods.php      - This plugin is designed specifically for Day of Defeat: Source, and adds weapon class and skill weight columns to the weapons table, as well as removing rounds played from the maps tables.

Credit goes to Stormtrooper for providing me with the basic code.  I just modified it to suit my purposes.
